| Name                | Role      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Atom                | item      | Elements that cannot be further divided. (e.g., buttons, chips, etc. Equivalents for Atomic design's atom.)                                                                           |
| Element             | item      | A collection of multiple Atoms. However, it cannot constitute a function by itself. (e.g., displaying an amount of money, etc. Equivalents for Atomic design's element.)              |
| Module              | Container | A collection of multiple Atoms or Elements that together constitute a stand-alone function. (e.g., cards, pagers, drop-downs, modals, etc. Equivalents for Atomic design's molecules) |
| List                | Container | A set of Elements or Modules of the same type (e.g., product listings, etc.)                                                                                                          |

| Page or Screen      | Screen    | Screen. When screen is reflowable, call it as Page. However, this distinction is not strictly necessary.                                                                              |
| Site or System, App | Solution  | A page, or set of screens, is a digital solution that encompasses multiple functions for one or more purposes.                                                                        |
